Hi

Here are some basic 68k assembly startup sources for Amiga.

Features at the moment include:
- no external includes or other files
- switching off the OS
- setting an AGA screen mode and custom copperlist
- setting up a chunky to planar routine (from Kalms)
- handling triple buffering
- setting a vblank interrupt for timing etc
- updating copperlist with new bitplanes and/or palette in vblank
- variation with 220x176 15 bit HAM8 mode
- variation with 320x176 8 bit palette mode

This has been tested with PhxAss and should compile simply by running:
	"phxass 8bpl-test.s"
	"phxass ham-test.s"

The init stuff is mostly written by "some people".
