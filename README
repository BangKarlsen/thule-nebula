**WORK IN PROGRESS**

* I STOLE EVERYTHING FROM dodke! See https://github.com/itslauri/amiga-startup
for the original repository. Thanks for providing such comfy starting grounds.

* Features a track from b3nny. He doesnt know yet.

* The idea is to mix asm and c.

* It compiles with vbcc/vasm. I tried getting more fancy gcc12 to work but had
  weird linker issues. For now vbcc is good enough and nice and simple.
