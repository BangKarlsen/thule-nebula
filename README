Hi

Here are some basic startup source codes for Amiga

Features at the moment include:
- switching off the OS
- setting an AGA screen mode and custom copperlist
- setting up a chunky to planar routine (Kalms')
- handling triple buffering
- vblank interrupt for timing and updating copperlist with new bitplanes and/or palette
- 2 variations, 220x176 15 bit HAM8 mode and 320x176 8 bit palette mode
- Tested with PhxAss
