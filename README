*WORK IN PROGRESS*

Here are some basic m68k asm demo startup sources for Amiga 1200/4000.

Features at the moment include:
- switching off the OS
- AGA screen mode and custom copperlist
- setting up a chunky to planar routine (from Kalms)
- triple buffering
- a vertical blank interrupt for timing and other per frame code
- updating copperlist with new bitplanes and/or palette in vblank
- variation with 220x176 15 bit HAM8 mode
- variation with 320x176 8 bit palette mode

The main goals for this project are to keep it really simple to use, not require
any external libraries or includes and to support compiling on any OS.
I'm planning on adding C headers and a test program soon.

This has been tested mainly with PhxAss and should compile simply by running:
	"phxass 8bpl-test.s"
	"phxass ham-test.s"

Using vasm should also work and I've tried it for cross compiling on a Mac:
	"vasmm68k 8bpl-test.s -Fhunkexe -o 8bpl-test"

The init stuff is mostly written by "some people".

If you need help talk to the old farts on #amycoders @ IRCNet

- dodke / unique, supergroup etc
