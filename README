*WORK IN PROGRESS*

Here are some fairly basic m68k asm demo startup sources for Amiga 1200/4000.

Features at the moment include:

- switching off the OS
- AGA screen mode and custom copperlist
- setting up a chunky to planar routine (by Kalms)
- triple buffering
- a vertical blank interrupt for timer and other per frame code
- updating copperlist with new bitplanes and/or palette in vblank
- ADPCM music replayer (by BriteLite)
- variation with 320x176 8 bit palette mode
- variation with 220x176 15 bit HAM8 mode

The main goals for this project are to keep it really simple to use,
not require any external libraries or includes and to support compiling on
any OS. I'm planning on adding C headers and a test program soon.

This has been tested mainly with PhxAss and should compile simply by running:
	"phxass test8bpl.s"
	"phxass testham.s"

Using vasm should also work and I've tried it for cross compiling on a Mac:
	"vasmm68k test8bpl.s -Fhunkexe -o test8bpl"

The 8 bpl test now includes music playback using an ADPCM routine from
BriteLite. It has been tested to work with at least files saved using
Audacity in .wav IMA 4:1 ADPCM format at a sample rate supported by Paula.

The init stuff is mostly written by "some people".
