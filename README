Here are some basic 68k assembly startup sources for Amiga.

Features at the moment include:
- no external includes or other files
- switching off the OS
- setting an AGA screen mode and custom copperlist
- setting up a chunky to planar routine (from Kalms)
- handling triple buffering
- setting a vertical blank interrupt for timing etc
- updating copperlist with new bitplanes and/or palette in vblank
- variation with 220x176 15 bit HAM8 mode
- variation with 320x176 8 bit palette mode

This has been tested mainly with PhxAss and should compile simply by running:
	"phxass 8bpl-test.s"
	"phxass ham-test.s"

Using vasm should also work and I've tried it for cross compiling on macOS:
	"vasmm68k 8bpl-test.s -Fhunkexe -o 8bpl-test"

The main goal for this project is to keep it really simple to use and
not require any external libraries or includes. I'm planning on adding C headers and a test program soon.

The init stuff is mostly written by "some people".
